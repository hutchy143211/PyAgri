Python based GPS code using pyqt5 for the main GUI. Build to read NMEA strings from a GPS receiver using the GxGGA format. These strings are then parsed and the wgs84 coordinates converted to a UTM projection along with the relevant region i.e. UTM 30U. The software is currently in the very early stages, but allows for a base point to be set which all relevant calculations are based on (to avoid coordinates with 600,000m values etc) as well as stat/pause/stop the GPS serial data stream. It is also possible to define an AB line from setting 2 points which then display euclidean distance from the line. These values can then be used with an integrated lightbar to show the current crosstrack error.

Currently most progress is focused on implementing threads for hardware both input and output such as buttons, LEDs, switches, buzzers, etc
